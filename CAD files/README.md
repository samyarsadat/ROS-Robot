## CAD Files:

### .SLDPRT & .SLDASM:
These files are for people that have access to Solidworks.<br>
These files are ideal for editing.<br>

<br>

### .STEP:
These are editable files that can be opened with almost any CAD software.<br>
These are for people that want to edit the project but don't have Solidworks.<br>

<br>

### .STL:
These are non-editable files used for 3D printing.<br>
They can be easily imported into all 3D printer slicer software.<br>

## Improvements for re-design (Stage 4):
 - **1.**&nbsp; *Add a hole to the back half of the mid plate for wire passthrough.*
 - **2.**&nbsp; *Add two indents to the sides of the mid plate so that it can be removed without having to remove the side ultrasonics.*
 - **3.**&nbsp; *Reinforce motor mounts. (Not necessary. However, it might be beneficial when more weight is added to the robot.)*
 - **4.**&nbsp; *Add cable channels (or holes for zip ties) for better cable management and to prevent too much stress from being put on solder joints/connectors.*
 - **5.**&nbsp; *Remove the need for motor shaft attachments by integrating them into the design of the wheels. (Might be implemented earlier)*
 - **6.**&nbsp; *Add indents to the bottom of the robot for IR edge fall-off sensor mounting.*
 - **7.**&nbsp; *Add accommodation for mounting lights to the bottom of the robot.*
 - **8.**&nbsp; *Increase hole tolerances.*
 - **9.**&nbsp; *Add proper mounting holes for voltage regulators and main control board PCB.*
 - **10.**&nbsp; *Fix motor driver mounting hole spacing.*
 - **11.**&nbsp; *Add mounting for the battery.*
 - **12.**&nbsp; *Add holes to the side of the robot to expose the Raspberry Pi's I/O ports.*
 - **13.**&nbsp; *Add mounting for a screen. (Potentially)*
 - **14.**&nbsp; *Add mounting for a cooling fan in the electronics (top) bay.*
 - **15.**&nbsp; *Add a hole for the resettable fuse(s).*
 - **16.**&nbsp; *Change camera mounting to fit the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3.*
 - **17.**&nbsp; *Add small vent holes around the robot.*
 - **18.**&nbsp; *Add mounting in the front for an 8-led SK6812 module.*
